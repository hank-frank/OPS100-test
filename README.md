Instructions: 
Honestly I'm not 100% on the instructions for this. 

I pulled the git repository with most of the working files. 

I ran gulp functions(maybe th right word for them) to process functions that created files, moved files, read files... 

These were added in the gulpfile.js which I think the gulp I called in terminal read to apply to all these files. 

This is as far as I understand this. I want to remember to come back and explain this better when I finally do understand this more fully. # github-upload
